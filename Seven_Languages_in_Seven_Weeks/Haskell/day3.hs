module Main where
	-- Prob 1 
	-- Write a function that looks up a hash table value that uses the Maybe monad. Write a hash that stores other hashes, several levels deep. Use the Maybe monad to retrieve an element for a hash key several levels deep.
	
	
	-- Prob 2 
	-- Represent a maze in Haskell. You¡¯ll need a Maze type and a Node type, as well as a function to return a node given its coordinates. The node should have a list of exits to other nodes.
	
	-- Prob 3
	-- Use a List monad to solve the maze.

	
	-- Prob 4
	-- Implement a Monad in a nonfunctional language. (See the article series on monads in http://moonbase.rydia.net/mental/writings/programming/monads-in-ruby/00introduction.html)
