complex problems by breaking them down into 
simpler subproblems”

## Steps for solving DP problems ##
1. Define subproblems
2. Write down the recurrence that relates subproblems
3. Recognize and solve the base cases
4. Each step is very important!

## Remember the three steps!  ##
1. Defining subproblems
2. Finding recurrences
3. Solving the base cases
